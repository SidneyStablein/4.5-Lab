      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>My passion for graphic design started in 2017, when I first started to use Adobe Photoshop and Illsutrator for an art assignment in highschool. Since then I have worked 
        as a Designer & Social Media Coordinator on a local newspaper and as an Graphic Design intern at Service Express. Reading “Hooked” and through taking classes for my degree
        in Business Administration, I became fascinated with psychology in relation to consumer marketing. Both have led me to where I am now, with a new passion for User Experience 
        design and research. </p>
